   *Menu bar* 
   
The first three menus of the menu bar (i.e. Data, Maps and About) are identical to the menus of GeoNode. Further details can be found at the website of `GeoNode <http://geonode.org>`_ and its 
`documentation <http://docs.geonode.org/en/master/tutorials/users/index.html>`_.

and then (If logged in) share the resulting map for public viewing.
